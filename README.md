# Postin App (Reddit Clone)

My first NodeJS Express project, replicating some of the features found in Reddit such as posts, comments and voting. I'm using Mongo DB with Mongoose to store the users and posts on the cloud.

## Features
- Posts 
- User authentication using PassportJS
- Voting

## How to deploy/run the web application

- The web app can be found here on [Heroku](https://postin-app.herokuapp.com/).
- To run the application locally, you first will have to clone the repo and then in the parent directory run the command:

```
node app.js 3001
```

## Features to be added 
- Comments
- Channels (Subreddits)
